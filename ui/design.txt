UI design:

Every UI has a parent except ui.base.root, which should be used as the root of the UI node tree.
For a list of events, check the stubs at the end of /base/node.lua

/widgets/:
Leaf nodes without children. Extend ui.base.node
Use :[event]() to handle events were needed.

Required dimension/color information should be gotten from a "style" table passed as an argument to the constructor.
The constructor should explicitly check for all the requird fields of the style and error if they're not set.
(To have a concise place were all the field are mentioned)
Non-required (style) fields should also be mentioned somewhere in the constrcutor.
Dynamically changing the style should work (by :setStyle())

/layout/:
These UIs are containers that position and resize their children. Extend ui.base.container
They should specify their own :resized() event handler.
Use :on[Event]() to execute events after they're normally executed.
Overwriting :[event]() prevents the event from propagating trough to the children.
:preDraw() exists to draw something before/behind the children.

Styles work the same as in widgets, except dynamically changing them doesn't need to be supported.
(Only using the constructor style is fine)

/tools/:
These UIs are allowed to use the settings global (layouts should be generic and aren't).
